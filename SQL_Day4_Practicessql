-- final hour practice
-- combine what we learned:




-- get the employee count of each department 
-- the result should include 2 coluns:
--department_name, employees_count
-- coma means it is separation between columns

select d.department_name , COUNT (e.first_name) as employee_count 
from employees e
inner join departments d on e.department_id = d.department_id
group by d.department_name
order by 2; -- must always be the last line


-- on top of above query
-- only list the department names starting with A or end ending with ng
select d.department_name , COUNT (e.first_name) as employee_count 
from employees e
inner join departments d on e.department_id = d.department_id
group by d.department_name
having d.department_name like 'A%' or d.department_name like '%ng';

-- if you are using count(*) for condition you can only use it with having 
-- if your condition does not involve aggregare you can filter directly with where

-- where clause does not work aggeregate function: 
-- but this one below will work becayse we dont use count(*) for condition part
-- we can direcrly filer out the result first
-- then do the grouping

select d.department_name , COUNT (e.first_name) as employee_count 
from employees e
inner join departments d on e.department_id = d.department_id
where d.department_name like 'A%' or d.department_name like '%ng'
group by d.department_name;


-- by extending above query, return the department name with more than 5 employees

select d.department_name , COUNT (e.first_name) as employee_count 
from employees e
inner join departments d on e.department_id = d.department_id
where d.department_name like 'A%' or d.department_name like '%ng'
group by d.department_name
having count(*) > 5;


-- how many departments in each country:
-- countries -<coutry_id>- Location -<Location_Id>- Department

select c.country_name , count (d.department_name)
from departments d
outer join locations l on d.location_id =d.location_id
inner JOIN countries c on c.country_id = c.country_id
group by c.country_name;


select c.country_name , count (d.department_name)
from departments d
right  join locations l on d.location_id =l.location_id
right JOIN countries c on l.country_id = c.country_id

group by c.country_name
order by 2;
