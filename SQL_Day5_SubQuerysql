-- find out the highest earner first_name im employees table

select max(salary) from employees;

select first_name from employees where salary = 24000;


-- in this below example we did grouping and just copy/pasted the existing query.
SELECT FIRST_NAME FROM employees
WHERE SALARY = ( select max(salary) from employees );


-- find out the min salary guy:

SELECT FIRST_NAME , LAST_NAME FROM employees
WHERE SALARY = ( select min(salary) from employees );

SELECT FIRST_NAME , LAST_NAME , salary FROM employees
WHERE SALARY > ( select avg(salary) from employees )
order by 3 desc
;


-- find the second max salary:
select max(salary) from employees where salary != (select max(salary) from employees)
;
-- find out the name of above person with the
-- second high salary using multiple query in one query

select first_name from employees where salary = 
                    (select max(salary) from employees where salary 
                    != (select max(salary) from employees));

-- how to return max and min salary in one column
-- the column name should be result, it should have 2 rows

select max(salary) as result from employees
union
select min(salary) as result from employees;


-- find out the name of people who make  max and min salary:

SELECT FIRST_NAME, SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY IN(SELECT MAX(SALARY) AS RESULT FROM EMPLOYEES
                UNION
                SELECT MIN(SALARY) AS RESULT FROM EMPLOYEES);
                
                -- the same thing without using Union
                
select first_name , salary from employees
where salary in ((select max(salary) as result from employees),
-- we use in here instead of "=" because one salary can not be equal to another

(select min(salary) as result from employees ));
